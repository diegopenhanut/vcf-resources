<body>FT : sample genotype filter indicating if this genotype was _called_ (similar in concept to the FILTER field). Again, use PASS to indicate that all filters have been passed, a semi-colon separated list of codes for filters that fail, or _.ˆ to indicate that filters have not been applied. These values should be described in the metainformation in the same way as FILTERs (String, no white-space or semi-colons permitted)
